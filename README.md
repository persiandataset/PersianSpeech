# PersianSpeech

In this repository, I put the Persian speech dataset along with the related text.

In this <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cCWH_eoa4Nq17XDHn6e1WIfHomdGWPKO/view?usp=sharing'>link</a> , I put a dataset related to ASR task in Persian language with a duration of 3 hours. 
The label of each audio file is in the form of a sentence and the duration of each file is about 10 seconds.</br>
This dataset is not copied from anywhere and it is my personal project that I publish freely. You can use it in your projects.</br></br>
Also, if you want to have a 30-hour dataset like this, you can contact me. hubare.ra[at]gmail.com
</br></br>
myaudio_tiny is tiny dataset with a duration of 3 hours. </br>
myaudio_full is big dataset with a duration of 30 hours.
